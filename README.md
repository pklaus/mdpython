### mdpython

**mdpython** is a Python toolkit for software raids created using `mdadm`.
It is meant to provide an interface to the status output of `/proc/mdstat`.
Python-bindings for the status output of `mdadm` may be added later on.

In addition, mdpython provides a small web server written using
[bottle.py](http://bottlepy.org) that provides status information of the
software raids running on the system.
